# Coursework-5-Day-Planner
Coding Bootcamp Coursework 5 - Day Planner

A web page which lets the user enter and save text for each hour slot in their working day (9am-5pm).
The page displays any text that the user previously saved.
The page shows the current time and date. 
Time slots change colour depending on the current time of day (grey = past, red = present, green = future).

No installation required.

To use this site, type whatever text you want into the coloured text area. Then click the save button on the right hand side to save that text.
